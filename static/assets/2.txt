Description:
The title “Live More” refers to living a life to the maximum extent, a little bit more than you are already doing.
Flowers attached to a peacock convey how to bloom. Brightly, neglecting the thought of competing flowers around, it just blooms. 
A butterfly symbolises acceptance of each new phase in life. 
Their average lifespan is a mere five to fourteen days. Life is short, so embrace it.
Acrylic flowers represent “detachment”, from the foundation. 
When life seems to be over consuming, it’s okay to detach yourself and go with the flow. 

What we see depends more on where we look from then on what we look at.
This artwork appears to be brighter
being viewed from the side rather than straight.
Sometimes all it takes is a change of perspective for life to be something “More”.
