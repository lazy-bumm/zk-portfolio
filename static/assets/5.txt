Description:
When thoughts beneath are all green,
Beautiful spark on the outside can be seen. 


This piece is a statement about the connection between our viewpoint and its consequences. 
If you look the right way, you can see that the whole world is a garden.
For a tree to stand tall, we need to nurture its roots. These green circles serve as a foundation of trees, akin to thoughts in our mind.
The more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you attract great things into your life.
