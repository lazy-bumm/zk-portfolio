Description:
Only you can fix my broken piece,
Watching you is listening to the sound of peace.


In this artwork, I tried to manifest the bond between music and peace.
Research has confirmed that music is effective for relaxation and stress management.
When it comes to improving brain health, music could be an element that enhances brain function.
In contrast with bright colours,
The deep, sophisticated sea green of the background creates a harmonious combination.
I take comfort in my impermanence revel.
Where shining bright colors have the power to influence the darkness of my soul, and music acts as a weapon in the war against unhappiness.
