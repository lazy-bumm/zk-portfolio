Description:
The title "Reflection on Action", refers to the exploration of one's beliefs and thinking about what needs changing for the future.
In this artwork, I tried to capture the liminality between despondency and self exploration.
The wings with positivity written all over are all set to fly, yet they are uncertain.
It portrays a retrospective contemplation of practice to explore oneself.
In this piece, with the interaction between black and white, I tried to exhibit a physical emergence from darkness to light and from thinking to implementing.
