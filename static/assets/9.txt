Description:
How magical that air has felt,
Let me fly again before it all melts.


Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.”  Leonardo da Vinci
Like butterflies dancing on the wind, this painting is a narration of how some memories bring pleasant serenity.
The memories I’ve made along the way give back moments of life that no longer exist.
Here, the magic of those feelings can be fantasized through the fusion of delighted colours.
This piece is a reminder to live a life and dance like a butterfly while creating memories so you can smile even if everyone else is crying in the final moments.
