Description:
Destructive surroundings indeed,
Will make you Bleed.

As quoted by Alexander Den Heijer, “When a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.” 
This piece depicts that the right vision in the wrong place is like the right seed in the wrong soil.
In contrast with bright colours representing honesty, cheerfulness, positivity, and sweetness, you are surrounded by an idle, dark environment.
Throughout my life, I have struggled with trauma and turmoil beyond my control, but actively working to alter my own beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours endows me with the sense that what I need to fix is Myself. 
Healing begins the moment you choose to prioritise yourself.
Sometimes, self-destruction is merely a wake-up call to change your path and seek a better life.
