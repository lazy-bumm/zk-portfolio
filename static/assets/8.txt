Description:
Away from gusty winds & aches,
Let me Escape...
To my world of peace;
Where magic is all I create!!!


The concept of this painting is locating inner peace in this chaotic world.
The avoidance of reality by absorption of the mind in an imaginary world, where you can find peace.
According to the Patrick Rothfuss quotation, There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow that it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is.
There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind.
The flowing music drowns out the voices of undesired people, and the sweet scent of flowers inspires to live forever.
