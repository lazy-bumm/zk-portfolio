Beyond
Medium: Acrylic paint and paper on canvas board.
Size: 24 x 24
Description:
Maybe in the sky,
I am searching for that missing bond,
Let me fly high,
Let me go beyond.

This piece illustrates internalized commotion through the vast outspread of wings. 
The blue of the exteriors with the loud colours of the core to convey “leisure”.
It describes how the playful and active bird macaw takes comfort in the cold solus sky, as it is free of all that toxicity on land.
This painting is a statement about bright, bold, loud, rising flair macaw.
There is no such thing as flying without wings.
To achieve eternal bliss, one must find their own wings that will help them to fly high.
