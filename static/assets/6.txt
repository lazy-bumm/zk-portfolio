Description:
At first it might feel strange,
But only time will reveal the beauty of change. 


The theme of this art is to appreciate change.
When you try too hard to bend life—infinitely complex—to your own will, inevitably, life will work you.
Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes.
Here the butterfly exemplifies change, transition, and growth.
Around the world, sunflowers have special cultural importance.
 Aside from their rich golden hues, they face towards the sun, always looking on the bright side!
Inspiring us to bloom like a sunflower, live a life filled with joy and positivity, and appreciate change.
